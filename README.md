## MY PERSONAL PYTHON PROJECT: BUILDING GUI VISUALIZE DATA IN MANY TYPES OF GRAPH.

### I. Description:

I will build a small GUI to show data visualiaztion in many types of graph
I will import some neccesary libraries to draw graphs.
I will use three powerful Python libraries: Tkinter, pandas, matplotlib. Tkinter will help us create the graphical user interface (GUI), while pandas and matplotlib will handle the data analysis and data visualization.

### II. Functionality:

These are some functionality in my app:

Import CSV files button: We can choose and import csv files, which you need visualize the data.
Type of graph button: We can choose the type of graph, you want to draw.
Plot graph button: Use this button to show the graph for users, choose the column in data frame to show the graph.
### III. Architecture:

I will import some neccesary libraries: Tkinter to handle GUI, created the functional button.
Import Pandas to read csv files, and analyze the data.
Matplotlib to draw the graph.
